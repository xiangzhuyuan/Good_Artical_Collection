"How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" Chinese Version

Well, when I made question on stackoverflow site, then the site administrator cloesed my question.
I was told that my qestion was not so constructed on site, so they turned off my question, and 
I found the link on stackoverflow site.


I access the site: [http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html].
In that page, I saw there was a Chinese, and I clicked, but that had gone, so I think I need make a never lost page.
