	<h2>Writing the perfect question</h2>

	<p>
		<strong>Update: now that I've actually posted this, I've
			added a tinyurl to it for easy reference: <a
			href="http://tinyurl.com/so-hints">http://tinyurl.com/so-hints</a>.
			Nice and easy to remember for comments :)
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		A while ago, I wrote a <a
			href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2009/02/17/answering-technical-questions-helpfully.aspx">blog
			entry</a> on how to <em>answer</em> questions helpfully on sites like <a
			href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. Recently I saw <a
			href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/59991">a meta
			question about bad questions</a> and thought it would be worth following
		up with another blog post on <em>asking</em> questions. For the sake
		of convenience - and as Stack Overflow is so popular - I will assume
		the question is going to be asked on Stack Overflow or a similar Stack
		Exchange site. Most of the post doesn't actually depend on that, but
		if you're asking elsewhere you may need to tweak the advice a little.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are plenty of similar resources around, of course - in
		particular, Eric Raymond's <a
			href="http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to Ask
			Questions the Smart Way</a> is a perennial favourite. Still, I think I
		can bring something to the table.
	</p>
	<h2>The Golden Rule: Imagine You're Trying To Answer The Question</h2>
	<p>
		If you don't remember anything else from this post, remember this bit.
		Everything else follows from here. (And yes, this does smack somewhat
		of <a
			href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:12&amp;version=NIV">Matthew
			7:12</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you've finished writing your question, read it through. Imagine
		you were coming to it fresh, with no context other than what's on the
		screen. Does it make sense? Is it clear what's being asked? Is it easy
		to read and understand? Are there any obvious areas you'd need to ask
		about before providing an answer? You can <em>usually</em> do this
		pretty well however stuck you are on the actual question. Just apply
		common sense. If there's anything wrong with the question when <em>you're</em>
		reading it, obviously that will be a problem for whoever's actually
		trying to answer it. So fix the problems. Improve the question until
		you can read it and think, "If I only knew the answer to the question,
		it would be a pleasure to provide that answer." At that point, post
		and wait for the answers to come rolling in.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Obviously this is somewhat easier to do if you have a certain
			amount of experience answering questions, particularly on the forum
			where you're about to post. So, what should you be looking out for?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Question title</h2>
	<p>
		When a reader first sees your question, they're likely to be scrolling
		down a list of snippets. The most eye-catching part of the snippet
		will be the title - so use that text wisely. While you <em>can</em>
		include language or platform information, you should only do so
		naturally - not as a sort of "header". For example, this is bad:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Java: Why are bytes signed?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>But this is okay:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Why are bytes signed in Java?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Of course, you should <em>also</em> include this information in tags,
		as it will help people who pay particular attention to specific tags.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ideally, a question title should be a question - but frankly that's
		not always feasible. I would recommend favouring a short, descriptive
		title which captures the theme of the question without actually <em>being</em>
		a question instead of really trying to crowbar it into the form of a
		question when it really doesn't want to be. That's not an excuse for
		laziness though - it's <em>usually</em> possible to come up with a
		good title which is genuinely a question.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's important that the question title is <em>specific</em> though,
		and has at least some meaning with no other information. A question
		such as "Why doesn't this work?" makes absolutely <em>no</em> sense
		without the rest of the question. Likewise a "question" title of
		"Please help" is unlikely to do well.
	</p>
	<h2>Context</h2>
	<p>In most cases, anyone answering the question will need to know
		what language and platform you're using. The basics should usually be
		communicated through tags, but it may very well be worth providing
		more information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Language version (e.g. C# 4)</li>
		<li>Platform version (e.g. .NET 3.5; note that this isn't always
			implicit from the language version, or vice versa)</li>
		<li>Operating system, if it could be relevant (e.g. particular
			permissions issues)</li>
		<li>Any other relevant software (e.g. database type and version,
			the IDE you're using, web server you're connecting to)</li>
		<li>Any other constraints. This is particularly important. It's <em>really
				annoying</em> to give a perfectly good answer to a question, only to be
			told that you're not allowed to use feature X or Y which provide the
			obvious solution.
			<ul>
				<li>If you have unusual constraints, it's worth explaining why.
					Not only does this answer the obvious follow-up comment, but it
					also gives more information about what <em>other</em> solutions may
					not be applicable.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Describe what you've already tried and the results of any research.
		(You <em>have</em> searched for a solution to your problem before
		asking it, haven't you? Stack Overflow isn't meant to replace basic
		search skills.) Often there will be other people in a similar
		situation, but the answers didn't quite match your situation. Just
		like the above point about unusual constraints, it saves time if you
		can point out differences between your situation and other common
		ones. It's even worth referring to other related questions explicitly
		- particularly if they're on the same forum. Aside from anything else,
		this shows a certain amount of "due diligence" - people are generally
		more willing to help you if can show you've already put some effort
		in.
	</p>
	<p>You should absolutely make sure that you tag the question
		appropriately. If you're not sure which exact tags are appropriate,
		see what gets auto-suggested and look at samples for each one. If that
		sounds like a lot of work, just remember how much time you may be able
		to save yourself in the long run. It gets easier over time, of course.</p>
	<h2>Problem statement</h2>
	<p>Make sure it's obvious what you're trying to get out of the
		question. Too many "questions" are actually just statements: when I do
		X, something goes wrong.</p>
	<p>
		Well, what did you expect it to do? What are you trying to accomplish?
		What have you already tried? What happened in those attempts? Be
		detailed: in particular, if something didn't work, don't just state
		that: tell us <em>how</em> it failed. If it threw an exception, what
		was the exception? (Don't just give the type - give the error message
		and say which line threw it. If there's a nested exception, post that
		too.)
	</p>
	<p>If at all possible, write a sort of "executive summary" at the
		start of your question, followed by a more detailed description.
		Remember that on the list of questions, the first few sentences will
		appear as a snippet. If you can get a sense of the question across in
		that snippet, you're more likely to attract views from people who can
		answer the question.</p>
	<p>One trap that many posters fall into is to ask how to achieve
		some "small" aim, but never say what the larger aim is. Often the
		smaller aim is either impossible or rarely a good idea - instead, a
		different approach is needed. Again, if you provide more context when
		writing your problem statement, we can suggest better designs. It's
		fine to specify how you're currently trying to solve your bigger
		problem, of course - that's likely to be necessary detail - but
		include the bigger goal too.</p>
	<h2>Sample code and data</h2>
	<p>
		I may be biased on this one. I'm a <em>huge</em> believer in sample
		code, both for questions and answers... and I probably use it in an
		unconventional way. I usually paste it into a text editor, and try to
		compile it from the command line. If that's not likely to work (and
		the problem isn't obvious by inspection), I'm unlikely to bother too
		much with it. Firing up Eclipse or Visual Studio and finding an
		existing project I don't care about or starting a new one is going to
		take much more time.
	</p>
	<p>
		That means if you want <em>me</em> to look at code, it should:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Be standalone. Don't try to talk to a database unless you
			really have to. (Obviously for database questions, that's kinda hard
			:) If you use sample XML, provide a short but <em>complete</em> XML
			file for us to reproduce the issue with. (And the same for other file
			types, obviously.)
		</li>
		<li>Be complete. If there are missing imports or using
			directives, that's really annoying</li>
		<li>Actually compile (unless the compilation error is the reason
			for the question). Don't give me code which is "something like" the
			real code but which clearly <em>isn't</em> the real code, and may
			well not exhibit the same symptoms by the time I've fixed it so that
			it compiles.
		</li>
		<li>Ideally not bring up a UI. Unless your code is <em>about</em>
			a UI issue, don't bring one up. Console apps are simpler, and
			simplicity is a huge benefit when trying to hunt down a problem.
		</li>
		<li>Demonstrate the problem. You should be able to say, "I
			expected the result to be X, it's actually Y." (You should actually
			say that too, so that we can check that we get the same results.)</li>
		<li>Be as short as possible. If I have to wade through hundreds
			of lines of code to find the problem, I'm doing work that <em>you</em>
			should be doing. Often if you work hard to reduce the problem to a
			short but complete program, you'll find the issue yourself. You can
			absolutely do this without knowing what the problem is; you should be
			looking to the community for their expertise, not their willingness
			to spend time on your problem doing the work that you can do
			yourself.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Yes, this is a relatively onerous list. It doesn't all apply to every
		problem, but it <em>does</em> apply in a great many situations. While
		I get put off by reams of irrelevant, badly formatted code, some of
		which clearly won't compile, the inverse is true as well: if I can
		tell by looking at the question that the code can go through a
		copy/paste/compile/run cycle really quickly, I'm <em>much</em> more
		likely to pay the question significant attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		In data-oriented questions, it's very often helpful to give some
		sample data. Cut out anything irrelevant (if your real table has 50
		columns, you only need to include relevant ones) but make sure that
		you give enough sample input for it to be meaningful. For example, if
		you're trying to group some data by a PersonID column, it's pretty
		useless if there's only one PersonID given, or if each PersonID only
		appears once. If you <em>are</em> giving examples of expected input
		and output, make sure it's clear <em>why</em> that's the expected
		output. Often I see questions which give a small number of samples,
		and there are various ways they could be interpreted. This is one area
		where it's particularly important to reread the question from a
		stranger's point of view: while a brief summary of the desired results
		may well make sense to someone who already knows what your app is
		trying to achieve, it may be gobbledygook to those trying to answer
		your question.
	</p>
	<h2>Spelling, grammar and formatting</h2>
	<p>
		I know not everyone speaks English natively. My own command of
		non-English languages is lamentably poor - I'm incredibly lucky that
		my native tongue happens to be the lingua franca of the technical
		world. However, if you're trying to communicate on an English-language
		forum, you owe it to yourself to make an effort to write at least <em>reasonably</em>
		correct English.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Please use capital letters where appropriate. It really can
			make a big difference in the readability of text.</li>
		<li>Please split your text into paragraphs. Imagine this blog
			post as one big paragraph - it would be almost impossible to read.</li>
		<li>Please write actual words. There are undoubtedly some
			abbreviations which are acceptable to most readers - IMO, IIRC etc
			-&nbsp; there's no reason to switch into text-speak with "gr8",
			"bcoz", "u" and so forth. It's unlikely that you're <em>actually</em>
			writing your question on a phone with only a primitive keyboard; show
			your readers respect by writing properly. It may take you a few more
			seconds, but if it means you get an answer quicker, it's surely worth
			the extra effort.
		</li>
		<li>Most browsers have built-in spelling checkers these days, or
			at least have plug-ins or extensions available to check your text.
			Technical text often creates a lot of false positives for checkers,
			but if your spelling isn't generally great, it's worth looking at the
			suggestions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Having said all of this, you're not trying to create a literary
		masterpiece. You're trying to communicate your question as effectively
		as possible. If you're faced with the choice between an unambiguous
		but ugly sentence, or a phrase which stirs the soul but leaves the
		reader confused about exactly what you mean, go for the unambiguous
		option every time.</p>
	<p>
		One way a huge number of questions can be improved with very little
		effort is simply formatting them properly. Stack Overflow's markdown
		editor is very good - the preview below your input box is almost
		always accurate in terms of the eventual result, and you can always
		edit the question later if anything doesn't quite work. The exact
		details of the markdown is beyond the scope of this article - Stack
		Overflow has a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help">detailed
			guide</a> though - if you're new to the site, I'd recommend you at least
		skim through it.
	</p>
	<p>By far the most important kind of formatting is making code look
		like code. Within a text paragraph, simply surround the code with
		backticks `like this`. For blocks of code, just indent everything by
		four spaces. If you're cutting and pasting code, it may already be
		indented (for example if you're copying code within a class) but if
		not, the easiest way to indent everything is to paste it, select the
		whole code block, and then press Ctrl-K or the “{ }” button just above
		the editor.</p>
	<p>One of the important things about code formatting is that it
		means angle brackets (and some other symbols) are preserved instead of
		being swallowed by the markdown formatter. In some cases this can mean
		all the difference between a question which is easy to answer and one
		which doesn't make any sense, particularly in terms of generics in
		Java and C# or templates in C++. For example, like this</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Why can't I convert an expression of type List&lt;string&gt; to
			List&lt;object&gt;?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>makes no sense at all if the type arguments are removed:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Why can't I convert an expression of type List to List?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Often experienced members of the site will recognise what's
		going on and edit your question for you, but obviously it's better if
		they don't have to.</p>
	<h2>Making a good impression</h2>
	<p>Leaving aside the main body of the question, there are a few
		simple ways to get the community "on your side" and therefore more
		likely to give you a useful answer quickly.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Register as a user and give yourself a meaningful name. It
			doesn't have to be your real name, but frankly names like "Top Coder"
			or "Coding Guru" look pretty silly when you're asking a question
			which others find simple. That's still better than leaving yourself
			as "user154232" or whatever identifier is assigned to you by default
			though. Aside from anything else, it shows a certain amount of
			commitment to the question and/or site: if you've bothered to give
			yourself a name, you're less likely to be an "ask-and-run"
			questioner.</li>
		<li>Keep an eye on your question. There may well be requests for
			clarification - and of course, answers! If you receive an answer
			which wasn't quite what you were looking for, explain carefully (and
			politely) why it's not suitable for your purposes. Consider going
			back and editing your question to make it clearer for subsequent
			users.</li>
		<li>Don't add your own answer unless it really <em>is</em> an
			answer. Often users add extra details in an "answer" when they should
			really have just edited their question. Likewise editing your
			question is generally a better idea than adding a long comment to an
			existing answer - particularly if that comment contains a block of
			code (which won't work well in a comment). If you do change the
			question in response to an answer though, it's worth adding a comment
			to the answer just to let the user know that you've updated it
			though... you may well find they quickly edit their answer to match
			the revised question.
		</li>
		<li>There's no need to include greetings and sign-offs such as
			"Hi everyone!" and "Thanks - hope to get an answer soon" in the
			question. These will often be edited out by other users, as they're
			basically a distraction. Greetings at the start of a question are
			particularly useless as they can take up valuable space in the
			snippet displayed in the question list.</li>
		<li>Above all, be polite. Remember that no-one is getting paid to
			answer your question. Users are giving up their time to help you - so
			please be appreciative of that. If you're asking a homework question,
			explain why you're asking for help with something that traditionally
			you'd have to answer all by yourself. If a user suggests that your
			general approach is wrong and that there's a better way of doing
			things, don't take it personally: they're trying to help you improve
			your code. By all means disagree robustly, but don't start into ad
			hominem arguments. (This advice applies to answerers as well, of
			course.)</li>
		<li>(Somewhat specific to Stack Overflow.) If an answer is
			particularly helpful or solves your problem, accept it by clicking on
			the tick mark by it. After you've asked a certain number of
			questions, an <em>accept rate</em> will be shown by your username in
			the question. Some users get annoyed with those with low accept rates
			(i.e. people who ask a lot of questions but rarely accept answers).
			Personally I'm not overly bothered by accept rates, but accepting an
			answer is still a generally good thing to do <em>if</em> it solved
			your problem. I certainly wouldn't suggest accepting answers just to
			get your accept rate, if they didn't help you.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Conclusion and feedback</h2>
	<p>
		Stack Overflow is an amazing resource (along with other Q&amp;A sites,
		of course). The idea that you can get a good answer to a wide range of
		questions within <em>minutes</em> is pretty staggering... but there's
		an obvious correlation between the quality of a question and the
		likelihood that you'll get quick, helpful answers. Put that extra bit
		of effort in yourself, and it will probably pay for itself very
		quickly.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm hoping to keep this blog post up to date with suggestions received
		- if I've missed out anything, over- or under-emphasized a specific
		point, or generally gone off track, let me know either in the comments
		here or mail me (<a href="mailto:skeet@pobox.com">skeet@pobox.com</a>).
		If this document ends up elsewhere, then that copy may end up being
		the "canonical" one which is edited over time - in which case I'll
		indicate that here.
